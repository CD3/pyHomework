      statement : Imagine that you where able to remove all of the negative charges on a 1981 penny and move it to the other side of the Earth.
                  What would the electrostatic force between the negative charge you remove and the positive charge left on the penny be?
                  (Pennies back then where solid copper with a mass of \SI{3.1}{\gram}).
