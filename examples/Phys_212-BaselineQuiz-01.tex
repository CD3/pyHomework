\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Estimate the number of free electrons in a \SI{3.1}{\gram} piece of copper ( x = 10).
    \vspace{1in}
    10 \pm 5%
    \vspace{1in}
    \item What does the phrase ``path of lease resistance'' refer to?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the tendency for current to flow through resistors
        \item current does as little work as possible along a path between any gwo points
        \item *current through parallel resistors is greater in the smaller resistor
        \item high voltage will always cause high current
    \end{enumerate}
    \item If a neutral conductor is brought close to a positivly charged insulating wall, what will happen? Explain.
    \vspace{1in}
    The conductor will be attracted to the wall because charge inside the conductor will be separated.
    \vspace{1in}
    \item If you speed is $v$, and you travel for some time $t$, how far have you traveled?
    \vspace{1in}
    $x = vt$
    \vspace{1in}
\end{enumerate}
