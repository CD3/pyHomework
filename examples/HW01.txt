Type: MC 
In problem #4, is it possible to place the electron and proton some distance appart such that the force of gravity is stronger than the electrostatic force? 
	*a. No, the ratio of the magnitude of the two forces does not depend on their separation distance. 
	b. Yes, if the proton and electron are brought very close together, the force of gravity will be larger. 
	c. Yes, if the proton and electron are separated by a very large distance, the force of gravity will be larger. 
	d. Yes, for short and long distances the electrostaitc force is greater, for for medium ranges, the force of gravity will be larger.
