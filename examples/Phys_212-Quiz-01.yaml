  - text: "In problem #${i}, assume that the electron and proton are separated by 0.50 m.
           What is the magnitude of the electrostatic force between the proton and electron?
           Give your answer in Newtons."
    answer:
      value: 9.23e-28

  - text: "In problem #${i}, is it possible to place the electron and proton
          some distance appart such that the force of gravity is stronger than
          the electrostatic force?"
    answer:
      a: ^No, the ratio of the magnitude of the two forces does not depend on their separation distance. 
      b: Yes, if the proton and electron are brought very close together, the force of gravity will be larger. 
      c: Yes, if the proton and electron are separated by a very large distance, the force of gravity will be larger. 
      d: Yes, for short and long distances the electrostaitc force is greater, for for medium ranges, the force of gravity will be larger.
