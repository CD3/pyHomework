    text: 'In problem #4, assume that the electron and proton are separated by 0.50 m. What is the magnitude of the electrostatic force between the proton and electron? Give your answer in Newtons.'
  -
    answer:
      choices:
        - '^No, the ratio of the magnitude of the two forces does not depend on their separation distance.'
        - 'Yes, if the proton and electron are brought very close together, the force of gravity will be larger.'
